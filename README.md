# Driver-Fatigue-Detection-System

The " Real Time Prevention Of Driver Fatigue Using Deep Learning " represents a system for
detecting driver drowsiness whose goal is to alert drivers of their sleepy state to prevent traffic
accidents which has been extensively discussed in this report. It is essential that drowsiness
detection in a driving environment be conducted in a non-intrusive manner and that the driver
not be troubled by alerts when they are not sleepy. We make use of the MediaPipe Facemesh
framework to extract facial features and the Binary Classification Neural Network to precisely
detect drowsy states in our solution to this open problem. The solution that minimizes false
positives is created to determine whether the driver exhibits sleepiness symptoms. The
approach extracts numerical features from images using deep learning techniques, which are
then added to a fuzzy logic-based system. This system typically achieve 91% accuracy on
training data and 92% accuracy on test data. The fuzzy logic-based approach, however, stands
out because it does not raise erroneous alerts (percentage of correctly identified footage where
the driver is not tired).
